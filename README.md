### Event Sourced CQRS Architecture Framework (ESCAF)

The intent is to develop an Event Source CQRS Architecture Framework for PHP web applications. The approach is to:

- Develop a repository access library
- Develop an event handling system (i.e. push/pull)
- Develop model aggregate managers that handle request validations for command senders
- Develop model projectors that create the query capabilities for the consumers

If you have questions or would like to join the development feel free to contact me.
